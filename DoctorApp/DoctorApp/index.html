      </div>
      <div class="document-content">

You may use the Apps and the information contained on them solely at your own sole risk.</p>
        <h4>II.   Children's Privacy.</h4>
        <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. You should be aware that the Apps are not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is a child under the age of 13. </p>

You must keep your account credentials confidential and not authorize anyone else to access or use the service on your behalf, unless we provide an approved mechanism for that. You must contact Customer Support right away if you suspect misuse of your account or any security breach in the service. You are responsible for all activity that takes place with your service account.</p>

        <h4>IV.   Internet Access May Be Required.</h4>
        <p>To access the Apps by means of a cellular data connection on a portable device (such as an iPhone), you will need a data access plan from your wireless carrier. In order to access the Apps via WiFi or Internet connection, you will need a compatible device, software, browser and Internet access. Check with your provider to learn if any fees apply. You are solely responsible for any fees or costs you incur to access the Apps through any wireless or other communication service.</p>
        <h4>V.    Your Content and Records.</h4>
        <p>We don't claim ownership of the content you provide on the service. Your content remains your content. We also don't control, verify, or endorse the content that you and others make available on the service.</p>
        <p>You control who may access your content, along with any co-custodians and other invited users. If you share content in your records, then you agree that anyone you've shared content with may use that content. When you give others access to your content on the service, they can use, reproduce, distribute, display, transmit, and communicate to the public the content. If you don't want others to have that ability, don't use the service to share your content.</p>
        <p>If you share content on the service in a way that infringes others' rights, including privacy rights, you're breaching this contract.

Deleted data may be irretrievable.</p>
        <p>he service is intended for travel use. It does not hold records for healthcare providers or other medical or case management purposes. For example, MORE records are not designated record sets as defined under U.S. Regulations. If a healthcare provider decides to include any data made available from MORE in its records, it should store a copy in its own system.</p>
        <p>MORE is a service for individuals to personally use in travel. You may use MORE for personal, but not for commercial, purposes. Organizations, companies, and businesses may not become registered members or use our Apps through individual members.

        <p>We do not recommend or endorse any specific Content, Services, tests, physicians, products, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on MORE. MORE is designed to be used with common sense, and in connection with the advice of your physician or your other healthcare provider. Reliance on MORE Content or Services is solely at your own risk. We work hard to bring you our very best, and believe that our members will find the Content and Services useful, but we cannot guarantee that the Content and Services will help you achieve any specific goals or results.</p>
        <p>Now or in the future, the Content and Services may link you to other websites or information, software, data, or other contents, on or off the Internet. These other sites or and contents are not MORE, and the information there is outside of our control. We do not control, endorse, or review the content of these sites. We do not review the contents that may be reached by such links, and we are not responsible for such content. The information, software, data, or other contents (including opinions, claims, comments) contained in linked references are those of the companies responsible for such sites, and should not be attributed to us. We have not attempted to verify the truth or accuracy of any such opinion, claim, or comment, nor do we endorse or support them. We do not warrant, nor are we in any way responsible for, information, software, data, privacy policies, or other content that is outside of our control.</p>
        <p>The Content and Services may not be used for any illegal purpose. You may not access our networks, computers, or the Content and Services in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair them, or interfere with any other person's use and enjoyment. You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any Content or Services, other accounts, computer systems, or networks connected with MORE, the Content, or Services. You may not use any automated means (such as a scraper) to access MORE, the Content, or Services for any purpose. Such unauthorized access includes, but is not limited to, using another person’s login credentials to access his or her MORE account. Any attempt by any individual or entity to solicit login information of any other user or to access any such account is an express and direct violation of these Terms of Use and of applicable law, including relevant privacy and security laws and laws prohibiting unfair or unethical business practices.
        </p>
        <p>If you violate any of these Terms of Use, your permission to use the Content and Services automatically terminates and you must immediately destroy any copies you have made of any portion of the Content.</p>
        <h4>VI.   Intellectual Property.</h4>
        <p>All software and content included on these Apps or used in the operation of the Apps is the owned or licensed property of MORE or its software and content suppliers and protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. The compilation (meaning the collection, arrangement, and assembly) of all content on the Apps is the exclusive property of MORE and protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. MORE grants you permission to view and use content and software made available to you on the Apps in connection with your own personal, noncommercial use of the Apps. Any other use, including the reproduction, modification, distribution, transmission, republication, display, or performance, of the content and software on the Apps is strictly prohibited.</p>
        <P>The trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and “look and feel” (the "Trademarks") used and displayed on the Apps are registered and unregistered Trademarks of MORE and others. Nothing on the Apps shall be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark displayed on the Aps, without the prior written permission of the Trademark owner. Other product and company names mentioned in the Apps may be the Trademarks of their respective owners.</P>
        <h4>VII.    International Members.</h4>
        <p>We make no claim that Content or Services are appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States. Personal information ("Information") that is submitted to MORE will be collected, processed, stored, disclosed and disposed of in accordance with applicable U.S. law and our Privacy Statement. If you are a non-U.S. member, you acknowledge and agree that MORE may collect and use your Information and disclose it to other entities outside your resident jurisdiction. In addition, such Information may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction. U.S. law may not provide the degree of protection for Information that is available in other countries. By providing us with your Information, you acknowledge that you consent to the transfer of such Information outside your resident jurisdiction as detailed in our Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to such transfer, you may not use our Content or Services. The product information provided on MORE is intended only for residents of the United States. Products identified on this site may have different product labeling and disclosure requirements in different countries. </p>
        <h4>VIII. Indemnification.</h4>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold MORE and its successors and assigns harmless from and against and in respect of any and all third party claims, demands, losses, costs, expenses, obligations, liabilities, damages, recoveries, and deficiencies, including interest, penalties, and reasonable attorneys' fees that it shall incur or suffer which relate to your use of the Apps, your failure to perform any of your obligations under these Terms of Use, or your breach of any of your representations or warranties made under these Terms of Use.</p>
        <h4>IX.   Changes to This Agreement.</h4>
        <p>We may change this contract, and will notify you by posting new terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must cancel and stop using the service. If you do not stop using the service, the new terms apply to you.</p>
        <h4>X.    No Warranty.</h4>
        <p>We provide the service "as-is," "with all faults" and "as available." The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the service and software is with you. Should the service or software prove defective, you assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing or repair. We don't guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of information available from the service. You acknowledge that computer and telecommunications systems are not fault-free and occasional periods of downtime occur. We do not guarantee the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, or that data loss will not occur. We and our affiliates and vendors give no express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. We exclude any implied warranties, including for merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, workmanlike effort, and noninfringement. You may have certain rights under your local law. Nothing in this contract is intended to affect those rights, if they are applicable.</p>
        <p>Third-party programs and devices that connect with MORE are not endorsed or warranted by MORE. Product descriptions are by their manufacturers and provided for informational purposes only. These Apps do not provide medical or any other health care advice, diagnosis or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition, diet, fitness or wellness program. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of information you accessed on or through the service.</p>
        <h4>XI.   Liability Information.</h4>
        <p><b>If you have any basis for recovering damages from MORE or its affiliates and vendors, you can recover only direct damages up to US $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect, incidental or punitive damages.</b></p>
        <p>The limitations and exclusions apply to anything related to this contract, such as loss of data; third-party content, programs or conduct; viruses that affect your use of the service; incompatibility between the service and other services, software and hardware; delays or failures you may have in starting or completing transmissions; and claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee or condition; consumer protection; deception; unfair competition; strict liability, negligence, misrepresentation, omission, trespass or other tort; violation of statute or regulation; or unjust enrichment; all to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
        <p>The limitations and exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose or if we knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.</p>
        <p><b>Nothing in these terms shall affect the statutory rights of any consumer or exclude or restrict liability for death or personal injury arising from our negligence, fraud, or our gross negligence or willful intent. Some or all of these limitations or exclusions may not apply to you if your state, province, or country does not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.</b></p>
        <h4>XII.    Changes to the Service and Cancellation.</h4>
        <p>We continuously work to improve the service and may change the service at any time. Additionally, there are reasons why MORE may stop providing portions of the service, including (without limitation) that it's no longer feasible for us to provide it, the technology advances, customer feedback indicates a change is needed, or external issues arise that make it imprudent or impractical to continue. If your service is canceled, your right to use the service stops immediately. Your ability to access and use some third-party programs may also stop right away.</p>
        <p>You may cancel the service at any time and for any reason. Sections X-XIII, and those that by their terms apply after termination of this contract will survive any termination of this contract.</p>
        <h4>XIII. General Legal Terms.</h4>
        <p>This Agreement, and the other agreements referenced in it (like our Privacy Policy), is the entire agreement between you and us relating to MORE. This Agreement replaces any prior agreements unless such prior or subsequent agreement explicitly provides otherwise and specifically references this Agreement. If there is any conflict between this Agreement and a mutually signed written agreement between you and us related to MORE, the signed written agreement will control.</p>
        <p>Other parties may have rights under this Agreement. A "third party beneficiary" is another party (for example, a company) who is not directly mentioned in an agreement, but who may have some rights arising out of an agreement. Our licensors may be third party beneficiaries to this Agreement pursuant to our agreements with them. To the extent our licensors are third party beneficiaries to this Agreement, the rights and protections provided to us under this Agreement inure to their benefit. Other than these licensors, there are no other third party beneficiaries to this Agreement. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement creates an agency, partnership, or joint venture.</p>
        <p>If we provide you with a translation of the English language version of this Agreement, the English language version of this Agreement will control if there is any conflict.</p>
        <p>If we choose not to enforce any provision of this Agreement, we still keep the right to enforce it in the future. This means that the failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of that provision. If any provision in this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, it and any related provisions will be interpreted to best accomplish the unenforceable provision's essential purpose.</p>
        <p>This Agreement is governed by California law, excluding California's choice-of-law rules. THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE FOR ANY DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IS SAN MATEO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. YOU AND US CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF THESE COURTS. Nothing in this Agreement limits either party's ability to seek equitable relief.</p>

        <h3>MORE HEALTH PRIVACY STATEMENT</h3>
        <p>(last updated 10/18/2014)</p>
        <p>MORE is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement applies to the data collected by MORE through MORE's website and mobile applications (the "Apps"). It does not apply to data collected by other online or offline MORE sites, products, or services.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="document-content">
        <h4>I.    Introduction.</h4>
        <p>The Apps are a medical support service that lets you gather, edit, add to, and store, information about your health through our Apps and share them with physicians.</p>
        <h4>II.   Collection of your personal information.</h4>
        <p>The first time you sign in to the Apps, the Apps asks you to create a MORE account. To create a MORE account, you must eventually provide personal information such as name, date of birth, e-mail address, address, postal code, phone number, gender, and country/region. Depending on which features you use, you may be asked for additional information for that feature.</p>
        <p>We will use the e-mail address you provide when you create your MORE account to send you an e-mail requesting that you validate your email address, to include in sharing invitations you send through the Apps and to send you App notifications.</p>
        <p>If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.</p>
        <ul>A MORE account allows you to manage health information about yourself. You choose what information to put in your records. Examples of the types of information you can store include:
          <li>medications</li>
          <li>allergies</li>
          <li>health history</li>
          <li>prior surgeries</li>
          <li>current medical conditions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of the information stored in the records you manage may be highly sensitive, so you need to consider carefully with whom you choose to share the information.</p>
        <h4>III.    Sharing the information in the Apps.</h4>
        <p>A key value of the Apps is the ability to keep track of your health information while you are traveling. You may choose with whom to share your information, and you can choose to share your information that you have entered into the Apps with other users whom you designate.</p>
        <h4>IV.   How we use your personal information.</h4>
        <p>We use personal information collected through the Apps, including health information, in the Apps, and as described in this privacy statement. We do not use or disclose your information except as described in this privacy statement.</p>
        <ul>In support of these uses, MORE may use personal information:
          <li>to provide you with important information about the Service, including critical updates and notifications;</li>
          <li>to send you the MORE e-mail newsletter, if you opt-in;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>MORE may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or respond to legal process served on MORE; or (b) protect the rights or property of MORE (including the enforcement of our agreements).</p>
        <p>MORE will not share any of your personal information in such a way that it can be used to personally identify you.</p>
        <p>Personal information stored in the service may be processed in the United States or any other country in which MORE or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities.</p>
        <h4>V.   How we use aggregate information and statistics.</h4>
        <p>MORE may use aggregated information from the Service to improve the quality of the Apps and for marketing of the Apps (for example, to tell potential advertisers how many Apps users live in the United States). This aggregated MORE is not associated with any individual account. MORE does not use your individual MORE account and record information from the Apps for marketing without MORE first asking for and receiving your opt-in consent.</p>
        <h4>VI.   Service access and controls.</h4>
        <p>You choose whether to create an account with the Apps. The required MORE account information consists of a small amount of information such as your name, e-mail address, region, and App credentials. We may request other optional information, but we clearly indicate that such information is optional. You can review and update your account information. You can modify, add, or delete any optional MORE account information by signing into the Apps and editing your account profile.</p>
        <p>You can close your MORE account at any time by signing into the Apps and editing your account profile. We wait 180 days before permanently deleting your MORE account information in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your information. Contact Customer Service if you want to reopen an account. Consider deletion carefully, because we may not be able to reopen it.</p>
        <p>When you close your MORE account, the Apps deletes all record for which you are the sole custodian.</p>

        <h4>VII.    Deleting records.</h4>
        <p>You can delete any record that you are a custodian of by signing in to your MORE account and editing a record's profile. We wait 180 days before permanently deleting the record information in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your information.</p>

        <h4>VIII. Deleting information.</h4>
        <p>When a person moves a piece of information to the trash, custodians may still view it there, and can restore it or delete it permanently from there at any time. </p>
        <p>Permanently deleting information removes it from the trash. Once someone permanently deletes an item, we cannot restore it. The Service adds an entry in your record history noting the name of the person who permanently deleted information and the date the deletion occurred.</p>

        <h4>IX.   E-mail controls.</h4>
        <p>To keep you informed of the latest improvements, MORE may send you a newsletter. You can choose whether to receive newsletters when you sign up for the Apps, or unsubscribe at any time.</p>
        <p>The service will periodically send you an email summarizing recent account activity. If you do not want to receive these emails, you can unsubscribe at any time.</p>

        <h4>X.    Security of your personal information.</h4>
        <p>MORE is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.  When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>


        <h4>XI.   Enforcement of this privacy statement.</h4>
        <p>If you have questions regarding this statement, you should first contact us at support@more-holdings.com.</p>


        <h4>XII.    Use of cookies.</h4>
        <p>We use cookies with the Apps to enable you to sign in and to help personalize the Apps. A cookie is a small text file that a web page server places on your hard disk. It is not possible to use cookies to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. A Web server assigns cookies uniquely to you and only a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you can read the cookies.</p>
        <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a Web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Using cookies simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the Web site, you can retrieve the information you previously provided, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized.</p>
        <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline some or all cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline all cookies, you may not be able to use interactive features of this or other Web sites that depend on cookies.</p>


        <h4>XIII.   Lost or stolen information.</h4>
        <p>You must promptly notify us if your credit card, user name, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that credit card number, user name, or password from your account and update our records accordingly.</p>

        <h4>XIV.    Changes to this privacy statement.</h4>
        <p>We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of the MORE Web site or by sending you a notification directly. We encourage you to review this privacy statement periodically to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the Apps constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates. </p>

        <h4>XV.   Contact information.</h4>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, contact us at support@morehealthmd.com.</p>

        <p>By checking the boxes next to the categories labelled “Alcohol or Drug Treatment,” “HIV-Related Information,” or “Mental Health Treatment Records,” and clicking “Submit,” which I hereby adopt as my electronic signature for this purpose, I affirmatively authorize and agree that MORE shall also be able to disclose such information subject to the terms and conditions described above.</p>
